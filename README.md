# FirstListing

FirstListing is a B2B-focused web application that identifies the original publisher of a real estate listing by matching the same property across multiple platforms and building a verified publication timeline.

## Project idea

The user provides a link to a real estate advertisement.  
The system extracts key information such as price, surface area, location, and images, and searches for the same property across multiple portals, agency websites, and private listings.

All matching listings are grouped together and ordered by publication date, making it possible to identify the original publisher (private owner or agent) and distinguish them from later intermediaries.

## Goal

The main goal is to save time, reduce duplicate work, and improve transparency in the real estate market by clearly identifying the first public listing of a property.

## Target users

- Real estate agents and agencies (primary users)
- Advanced private house-hunters (secondary users)

## Technical scope (planned)

- Web scraping
- Database storage
- Property matching algorithms
- Publication date comparison
- Optional image or location-based matching

## Status

This project is currently in an early prototype stage.
